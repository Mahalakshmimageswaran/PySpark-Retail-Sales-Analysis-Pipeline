**README: PySpark Retail Sales Analysis Pipeline
Project Overview**
This project implements an end-to-end data pipeline using PySpark to analyze retail sales data (superstore.csv). It processes, cleans, and aggregates sales records to derive insights into sales performance, category profitability, and trends, culminating in visualizations and business recommendations.

**Key Objectives**
* Build a scalable PySpark data pipeline for comprehensive retail analytics.
* Perform data cleaning, transformation, and quality checks (nulls, duplicates).
* Aggregate sales and profit by product categories.
* Visualize key metrics (sales, profit distribution, trends) using Matplotlib/Seaborn.
* Derive actionable business recommendations.

**Core Technologies**
* PySpark (pyspark.sql): For distributed data processing and DataFrame operations. Key functions include to_date, sum, round, mean, groupBy, fillna.
* Python: datetime for date manipulation.
* Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn (via Pandas DataFrames).

**Pipeline Summary**
* Setup & Ingestion: Initialize SparkSession, load CSV data into a Spark DataFrame.
* Data Cleaning & Transformation: Convert date strings to date types, handle null values (imputation with mean for numerics, earliest date for order dates), and check for duplicates.
* Data Filtering: Select data for a defined time period.
* Aggregation: Group data by Category to calculate Total Sales and Total Profit.
* Visualization: Convert aggregated Spark DataFrame to Pandas to plot:
      1. Bar chart: Total Sales by Category.
      2. Pie chart: Profit Distribution by Category.
      3.Line chart: Daily Sales Trends.
* Insights & Recommendations: Formulate business strategies based on analysis.
* (Conceptual Scalability Demo): Duplicated data to show PySpark's processing capability.

**Key Highlights**
* End-to-End Data Processing: From raw data to actionable insights.
* PySpark for Scalability: Demonstrates use of Spark for potentially large datasets.
* Data Quality Focus: Addresses common issues like nulls and data type mismatches.
* Insightful Visualizations: Clear charts for sales, profit, and trends.
* Actionable Outcomes: Provides data-driven business recommendations.

**Challenges & Solutions**
* Null Values:
Problem: Nulls in Sales, Profit, Order_Date affecting analysis.
Solution: Imputed numerical nulls with column means; date nulls with the earliest order date.
* Data Type Mismatches:
  Problem: Dates/numbers read as strings from CSV.
  Solution: Explicit type conversion using to_date() and ensuring numeric types for calculations.
* Visualizing Spark Data:
  Problem: Direct plotting from large Spark DataFrames is inefficient.
  Solution: Aggregated data in Spark, then converted to Pandas for matplotlib/seaborn.

**Key Visualization Insights & Business Impact**
* Top Sales Categories (Bar Chart): Identified leading revenue-driving categories (e.g., Technology), guiding marketing and inventory focus.
* Profit Distribution (Pie Chart): Revealed profitability per category (e.g., Technology 50.9% profit vs. Furniture 6.9%), highlighting areas for margin optimization or strategic focus.
* Sales Trends (Line Chart): Showed sales patterns over time, enabling better demand forecasting and planning for promotions during peak periods.

**Core Business Recommendations**
* Focus on high-performing categories (e.g., 'Technology').
* Optimize low-margin, high-sales categories (e.g., 'Furniture') for better profitability.
* Leverage sales trend insights for targeted marketing and inventory management.

This project showcases practical data engineering skills in building a PySpark pipeline, performing data quality checks, deriving insights through aggregation and visualization, and translating them into business value.

** Files Needed** 
To run this project, you will need the following file:
* superstore.csv: This is the primary dataset containing the retail sales records. Ensure this CSV file is located in the same directory as your Python script or Jupyter Notebook when executing the code.

How to Set Up and Run the Code
The project is designed to be executed in an environment that supports PySpark, such as Google Colab, a local PySpark installation, or a distributed Spark cluster.
1.Environment Setup:
o	Install PySpark: If you don't have PySpark installed, the first step is to install it using pip:
o	pip install pyspark

o	Dependencies: Ensure all necessary Python libraries (PySpark, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, datetime) are available in your environment.
o	Initialize Spark Session: The script begins by initializing a SparkSession, which is the entry point for interacting with Spark.
2.Execution Flow: The code is structured into sequential steps, typically run in a Jupyter Notebook or as a Python script. Each section performs a specific part of the data pipeline:
o	Parameterize Time Period Selection (Optional): You can define a time_period (e.g., "Weekly" or "Monthly") to dynamically set the start_date and end_date for data filtering.
o	Load Data: The superstore.csv file is loaded into a Spark DataFrame, and its schema and a sample of its contents are displayed.
o	Data Quality Checks and Transformation: This crucial step involves:
	Checking for null values in critical columns (Sales, Profit, Order_Date).
	Imputing numerical nulls with the mean of their respective columns.
	Imputing null Order_Date values with the earliest available order date.
	Converting Order_Date strings to proper date types.
	Identifying and reporting any duplicate records.
o	Data Filtering: The cleaned data is then filtered based on the start_date and end_date to focus on a specific analysis period.
o	Aggregation: Data is grouped by Category to calculate Total Sales and Total Profit, providing a summarized view of performance across product categories.
o	Visualization: The aggregated Spark DataFrames are converted to Pandas DataFrames to leverage Matplotlib and Seaborn for generating visual insights.
o	Scalability Demonstration (Optional): To showcase PySpark's capability with larger datasets, the existing cleaned data is duplicated, and the aggregation step is re-run on this larger dataset.
o	Business Recommendations: Finally, a set of derived business recommendations are printed, offering actionable strategies based on the analysis.


Expected Outputs
Upon successful execution of the pipeline, you can expect the following outputs:

**Console Output**
* Data Schema: A detailed printout of the DataFrame's column names and their inferred data types.
* Sample Data: The first few rows of the raw dataset, providing a quick glance at the data structure.
* Null Value Counts: Reports on the number of nulls in key columns before and after data cleaning, demonstrating the imputation process.
* Duplicate Records: A count indicating how many duplicate rows were found and handled.
* Order Date Samples: Examples of Order_Date values before and after type conversion.
* Filtered Data Count: The total number of records remaining after applying date-based filtering.
* Aggregated Sales Data: Tables displaying the Category, Total Sales, and Total Profit for both the original and the scaled (duplicated) datasets.
* Row Counts: A comparison of the original and scaled dataset row counts, highlighting the scalability demonstration.
* Business Recommendations: A list of strategic recommendations derived from the data analysis, printed directly to the console.
